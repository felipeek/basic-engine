# basic-engine

A very simple graphics engine written in C++ (but almost C-compatible; C++ used to ease integration with imgui). It can be extended to be used in graphics projects.

## Building

### Linux and OS X

You need libglew-dev and libglfw3-dev. Simply run:

```
$ make
```

The binary will be available in `./bin/basic-engine`.
